# perex - Python Environment for Relating Electrochemistry and XAS data
## The ECXAS package
As part of the European project BIG-MAP (Battery Interface Genome Materials Accelerated Platform, www.big-map.eu) a need for semi-automated data processing was identified during the acquisition of data from beamlines, coupled with electrochemical equipment for example. In the current state, these data arrive out of sync (for example time series of absorption spectroscopy and electrochemical potential during a charge-discharge cycle of a battery), which makes their representation complex. There therefore appears the need for a tool for aggregating asynchronous data and generating maps with a homogeneous appearance.

Here we present an example of an operando XAS experiment coupled with electrochemical characterization performed at ROCK beamline in Synchrotron SOLEIL.
